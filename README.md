# JOM. Inner, outer class. Enum
## Task 3

Suppose we have **execute** method with next signature:

where the **Strategy** is the next interface :

Using anonymous classes concept, call the **execute** method 4 times with different strategy (override method **doOperation** from **Strategy** interface):
1. Add a to b   \\   (a + b)
2. Subtract b from a   \\   (a - b)
3. Multiply a by b   \\   (a * b)
4. Divide a by b   \\   (a / b)

> For correct passing of all tests don't use print and println methods in your code.
